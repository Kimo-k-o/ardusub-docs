This page explains how to set up a Raspberry Pi for use with ArduSub.

## Easy Setup With Disk Image

With the simple method, you restore a `.img` file to the Raspberry Pi SD Card. This provides the operating system and everything already set up for running ArduSub. You can download the most recent disk image here:

<i class="fa fa-download" aria-hidden="true"></i> [Latest Ardusub-Raspbian Image](http://img.ardusub.com/ardusub-raspbian.img.gz) *(1.56 GB, Updated 2016-07-27)*

*(Raspbian Jessie Lite 2016-05-27 w/ ArduSub Companion Computer Setup)*

To load the image to your SD card, use the following instructions.

### Mac and Linux

Insert the SD card to a card reader, open a terminal, and run the following command to find the disk number of the SD card.

On Mac:

	diskutil list

On Linux:

	df -h

You can find the disk number in the output and it will look something like `/dev/diskX` or `/dev/sddX`. It may be `disk2`, `disk3` on Mac and `/dev/sdd1`, `/dev/sdd2` on Linux. You need to start by unmounting that disk.

On Mac:

	diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskX

On Linux:

	umount /dev/sddX

To write the disk image to the SD card, use the following command (on Linux, replace `bs=1m` with `bs=1M`):

	sudo dd bs=1m if=~/Downloads/ardusub-raspbian.img of=/dev/rdiskX

If the image is still compressed, you can combine the decompression and writing in one command:

	gunzip --stdout ardusub-raspbian.img.gz | sudo dd bs=1m of=/dev/rdiskX

Note that the location and name of `rasbian-ardusub.img` might be slightly different depending on where you downloaded it. Once complete, you can eject the SD card and install it on the Raspberry Pi. That's it!

## Setup From Scratch

These instructions are provided for those who wish to set everything up themselves.

### Install Raspbian and Set IP Address

Start with Jessie-Lite image downloaded from [raspberrypi.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) and follow their instructions to install it to an SD card.

1. Insert SD card to Raspberry Pi and allow to boot up for about 1 minute.
2. Remove SD card, insert to card reader, and modify the file `/boot/cmdline.txt` to have "ip=192.168.2.2" to the end of the line. It will look something like this (all one line):

		dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=serial0,115200 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline fsck.repair=yes rootwait ip=192.168.2.2

3. Insert the SD card back into the Raspberry Pi, connect the Ethernet directly to your computer (through a tether interface board if desired), and power it up.

### Set Up Internet Sharing

Please see the main [host computer setup](/initial-setup/#host-computer-setup) sections for details.

### Command Line Setup

All of this setup is completed on the command line. You must connect to the Raspberry Pi via SSH, using a client program like Putty or the Mac Terminal. The default password is `raspberry`.

	ssh pi@192.168.2.2

First, run `rpi-config` to expand filesystem and enable the camera.

1. Run `sudo raspi-config` on the command line.
2. Choose "Expand Filesystem", then "Ok"
3. Choose "Enable Camera", then "Yes", then "Ok"
4. Choose "Finish" and "Yes" to rebooting.

Next, update the current software and install the prerequisites needed.

	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install -y git

	# Update package lists and current packages
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade

	# Update Raspberry Pi
	sudo apt-get install -y rpi-update
	sudo rpi-update

	# install python and pip
	sudo apt-get install -y python-dev python-pip

	# install dronekit
	sudo pip install dronekit dronekit-sitl # also installs pymavlink
	sudo pip install mavproxy

	# install screen
	sudo apt-get install -y screen

	# live video related packages
	sudo apt-get install -y gstreamer1.0


Disable camera LED if using the v1 camera.

	sudo sed '$a disable_camera_led=1' /boot/config.txt

Clone the companion repository:

	git clone https://github.com/bluerobotics/companion.git

Add these lines to `/etc/rc.local` to automatically start `mavproxy` and the video stream. Add them before the `exit 0` at the end.

	screen -dm -S mavproxy /home/pi/companion/RPI2/Raspbian/start_mavproxy_telem_splitter.sh
	screen -dm -S video /home/pi/companion/RPI2/Raspbian/start_video.sh

Last, restart the Raspberry Pi

	sudo shutdown now -r

When it reboots, it will automatically start streaming video if the camera is connected and will automatically connect to the Pixhawk, if connected.

## Advanced

### Reentering Mavproxy and Video Processes

The `mavproxy` and video processes are started in "screen" sessions so that they can be reentered to view output and any errors that may have occurred. To reenter the sessions, open and SSH terminal to the Raspberry Pi and run the following commands:

	sudo screen -r video

	sudo screen -r mavproxy

To quit the process, press Ctrl-C. To exit without stopping the process, press Ctrl-A, then D to "detach" from the session.

### Backing Up Disk Image

On Mac or Linux, first find out the disk number of the SD card using `diskutil`.

	diskutil list

Find the SD card in the output. On Mac it will be something like `/dev/disk2` and on Linux it will be something like '/dev/sdb'.

*On Mac:*

	sudo dd bs=4m if=/dev/disk2 | gzip > rasbian-ardusub.img.gz

*On Linux:*

	sudo dd bs=4M if=/dev/sdb | gzip > rasbian-ardusub.img.gz

Press Ctrl-T to check on status while this is happening. It can take quite a while. 

To restore the image, see the simple setup instructions above.

### Flashing Pixhawk Through SSH

With an Ethernet tether and companion computer, it is possible to flash the Pixhawk firmware through the companion computer - no need to directly access the Pixhawk.

#### Flashing with Latest Build From the Internet

*These instructions are in alpha test phase! Use with care and patience.*

*Note: The default password for the Raspberry Pi is `raspberry`*

To use these instructions, your companion computer will have to be connected to the internet via internet sharing through the tether or a separate wifi connection. Please see the [internet sharing instructions](/raspi-setup/#set-up-internet-sharing) to set that up.

First make sure your companion computer has the most recent scripts. Execute this command from the host computer:

	ssh pi@192.168.2.2 "git --work-tree=/home/pi/companion --git-dir=/home/pi/companion/.git pull origin master"

Next, run the firmware updater script:
 
	ssh pi@192.168.2.2 "/home/pi/companion/RPI2/Raspbian/flash_px4.py --frame=vectored"

While the flashing command is running, you will see the script try to start the Pixhawk's bootloader multiple times. The output will look like this:

	if the board does not respond, unplug and re-plug the USB connector.
	attempting reboot on /dev/ttyACM0...

Eventually it should catch and reflash the board.

#### Flashing With a .px4 File

These instructions assume you already have a firmware file (ArduSub-v2.px4) from the [firmware repository](http://firmware.ardusub.com/) or that you [compiled yourself](/developer/). Run the commands from the section above to update your `companion` code to the most recent version and then run the following command to update the firmware:

	ssh pi@192.168.2.2 "/home/pi/companion/RPI2/Raspbian/flash_px4.py --stdin" < ArduSub-v2.px4
