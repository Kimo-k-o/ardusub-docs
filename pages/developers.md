## How to Get the Code

The ArduSub code is maintained in a *git* repository. The best way to get the code is to clone that repository.

	git clone https://github.com/bluerobotics/ardusub.git

You can also download the code as a zip file from the right sidebar of the <a href="https://github.com/bluerobotics/ardusub.git">Github website</a>.

## Compiling

- [Mac Instructions](http://dev.ardupilot.com/wiki/building-px4-with-make-on-mac/)
- [Linux Instructions](http://dev.ardupilot.com/wiki/building-px4-for-linux-with-make/)
- [Windows Instructions](http://dev.ardupilot.com/wiki/building-px4-with-make/)

To compile the ArduSub branch, first `cd ArduSub` to enter the directory and then use a command with the following format:

	make [board type]-[frame type]

For example,

	make px4-v2-vectored

The available board types can be seen by entering `make` with no arguments. Below are the available frame types.

| Frame          | Function                                                             |
|---------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bluerov`      | Compile for BlueROV thruster configuration                           |
| `vectored`     | Compile for vectored w/ side-by-side vertical thruster configuration |
| `vectored6dof` | Compile for vectored w/ corner vertical thruster configuration       |
| `simplerov`    | Compile for simple 3-4 thruster ROV                                  |

## Uploading

To upload the code to a PixHawk or similar controller, add `-upload` to the build command. For example:

	make px4-v2-vectored-upload

This only works with a direct USB connection to the Pixhawk. If you're using a companion computer and an Ethernet tether connection, you can upload the code through the companion computer. Please see the [Flashing Pixhawk Through SSH](/raspi-setup/#flashing-pixhawk-through-ssh) for instructions on how to do that.

## Running

The code begins running immediately once uploaded. For Linux-based autopilots, it must be launched or started with launch script. Please see the documentation for your respective autopilot.

The companion computer is also set up to start automatically and connect to the autopilot. Please see the [companion computer page](/raspi-setup/) for more setup details.

## Making a Custom Configuration

One of the biggest additions to the ArduSub code is a six degree-of-freedom motor library that allows a wide variety of motor configurations to be set up easily. The motors libraries for each configuration are built on a set of higher-level motor classes as follows:

    AP_Motors
        |---- AP_MotorsMulticopter
                       |---- AP_MotorsMatrix
                                    |---- AP_Motors6DOF
                                                |---- AP_MotorsBlueROV
                                                |---- AP_MotorsVectoredROV
                                                |---- AP_MotorsVectored6DOF
                                                |---- AP_MotorsSimpleROV
                                                |---- AP_Motors[New configuration]

To add a new motor configuration, you will create a new frame type and implement the `AP_Motors[New configuration]` for the new frame configuration.

## Adding Features
