## How to Get the Code

The ArduSub code is maintained in a *git* repository. The best way to get the code is to clone that repository.

	git clone https://github.com/bluerobotics/ardusub.git

You can also download the code as a zip file from the right sidebar of the <a href="https://github.com/bluerobotics/ardusub.git">Github website</a>.

## Compiling

- [Mac Instructions](http://dev.ardupilot.com/wiki/building-px4-with-make-on-mac/)
- [Linux Instructions](http://dev.ardupilot.com/wiki/building-px4-for-linux-with-make/)
- [Windows Instructions](http://dev.ardupilot.com/wiki/building-px4-with-make/)

To compile the ArduSub branch, first `cd ArduSub` to enter the directory and then use a command with the following format:

	make [board type]

For example, to build for the Pixhawk 1:

	make px4-v2

The available board types can be seen by entering `make` with no arguments.

## Uploading

To upload the code to a PixHawk or similar controller, add `-upload` to the build command. For example:

	make px4-v2-upload

This only works with a direct USB connection to the Pixhawk. If you're using a companion computer and an Ethernet tether connection, you can upload the code through the companion computer. Please see the [Flashing Pixhawk Through SSH](/raspi-setup/#flashing-pixhawk-through-ssh) for instructions on how to do that.

## Running

The code begins running immediately once uploaded. For Linux-based autopilots, it must be launched or started with launch script. Please see the documentation for your respective autopilot.

The companion computer is also set up to start automatically and connect to the autopilot. Please see the [companion computer page](/raspi-setup/) for more setup details.

## Making a Custom Configuration

One of the biggest additions to the ArduSub code is a six degree-of-freedom motor library that allows a wide variety of motor configurations to be set up easily. The motors libraries for each configuration are built on a set of higher-level motor classes as follows:

    AP_Motors
        |---- AP_MotorsMulticopter
                       |---- AP_MotorsMatrix
                                    |---- AP_Motors6DOF

To add a new motor configuration, you will need to add your custom motor setup to [AP_Motors6DOF.cpp](https://github.com/bluerobotics/ardusub/blob/master/libraries/AP_Motors/AP_Motors6DOF.cpp). Find the following line, and add your frame configuration there. The frame is configured at boot according to the FRAME_CONFIG parameter. You will need to change this parameter to CUSTOM to use your custom frame.

    case AS_MOTORS_CUSTOM_FRAME:
        // Put your custom motor setup here

The behavior of each motor will be defined by its assigned contributions to each of the 6 degrees of freedom in AP_Motors6DOF.cpp. You can use the other frame configurations as a reference guide to defining your own custom configuration. Here is the BlueROV1 frame configuration as an example:

|Motor #|Roll Factor|Pitch Factor|Yaw Factor|Throttle Factor|Forward Factor|Lateral Factor|
|1      |0          |0           |-1.0      |0              |1.0           |0             |
|2      |0          |0           |1.0       |0              |1.0           |0             |  
|3      |-0.5       |0.5         |0         |0.45           |0             |0             |    
|4      |0.5        |0.5         |0         |0.45           |0             |0             |     
|5      |0          |-1.0        |0         |1.0            |0             |0             |      
|6      |-0.25      |0           |0         |0              |0             |1.0           |
