First-time setup of the autopilot includes downloading and installing the QGroundControl GCS, mounting the controller to the vehicle, connecting it to the tether, power, and motors, and then performing initial configuration and calibration.

## Wiring and Connections

The exact wiring configuration depends on the vehicle configuration and the hardware used. The following are the standard channel assignments. Please see the [frame configurations](/introduction/#supported-frames) for standard thruster numbering.

| PWM Channel | Connection  |
|------------:|:------------|
| Channel 1   | Thruster #1 |
| Channel 2   | Thruster #2 |
| Channel 3   | Thruster #3 |
| Channel 4   | Thruster #4 (if used) |
| Channel 5   | Thruster #5 (if used) |
| Channel 6   | Thruster #6 (if used) |
| Channel 7   | Thruster #7 (if used) |
| Channel 8   | Thruster #8 (if used) |
| User Configurable | LED Lights  |
| User Configurable | Camera Tilt Servo |

The hardware also has other input/output ports including I<sup>2</sup>C and serial ports. These are the recommended connections for those ports.

| Port                    | Connection                             |
|------------------------:|:---------------------------------------|
| I<sup>2</sup>C          | Pressure sensor (MS58XX)               |
| Telem1 Serial Port      | Tether (if using serial)               |
| Telem1 Serial Port      | Companion computer (if using Ethernet) |
| Power Port              | Power Module                           |

### Tether Interface Wiring

To be completed.

## Install QGroundControl

We recommend using the most recent daily build of QGroundControl, which can be [downloaded and installed from here](http://qgroundcontrol.org/downloads). Downloads are available for Android, Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.

## Loading Firmware

Compiled firmware is now available and can be downloaded from [firmware.ardusub.com](http://firmware.ardusub.com). Firmware is only available for the following hardware right now:

* Pixhawk (px-v2)

Please see the [Developer section](/developers/) for instructions on how to compile from source.

### Loading Through QGC

1. Install the most recent version of [QGroundControl](#) and navigate to the *Firmware* tab of the settings page.

<img src="/images/qgc/firmware-1.png" class="img-responsive img-center" />

2. Plug in the Pixhawk to the computer's USB port. Once detected, QGroundControl will show a firmware selection box on the right. Choose "ArduPilot Flight Stack" and then check the "Advanced Settings" checkbox. From the dropdown box that appears, choose "Custom firmware file...".

<img src="/images/qgc/firmware-2.png" class="img-responsive img-center" />

3. Press "OK" at the top right and you will be prompted to select the firmware file (which will probably be named "ArduSub-v2.px4"). Make sure you [download the most recent firmware](firmware.ardusub.com) and choose it here.

The firmware will upload the Pixhawk and you'll see the following printout and success message.

<img src="/images/qgc/firmware-3.png" class="img-responsive img-center" />

## Connect QGC to Controller

The controller can be connected to QGC through several different methods depending on the hardware used.

### Serial Port Connection

If using a serial port, simply connect the port to the computer and open QGC. The controller should automatically connect to QGC and onboard data will be downloaded.

### Ethernet Connection with Companion Computer

If using an Ethernet connection with companion computer, you must must connect to the autopilot via `mavproxy`. This setup will work with a variety of configurations including:

- PixHawk Connected to Raspberry Pi via USB or serial

#### Raspberry Pi Initial Setup

We first need to configure the Raspberry Pi to connect directly over Ethernet without a router. This will require setting a static IP address so we can reliably connect to the Raspberry Pi. You can do this by adding the following to the end of the line in `/boot/cmdline.txt`.

```
ip=169.254.2.2
```

You should also set up your computer to have a static IP address when connected to the Ethernet connection. We recommend using the address 169.254.2.1.

Next you'll need to get the companion computer scripts. Make sure you have an internet connection to the Raspberry Pi and enter the following:

```
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install gstreamer1.0

git clone https://github.com/bluerobotics/companion.git
```

Next, we'll set up the companion computer scripts to run automatically at boot. Enter the following commands to do so:

```
cd companion/RPI2/Raspbian
sudo ./rov-setup.sh
```

### Ethernet Connection with Linux Autopilot (Navio, BBBmini, etc.)

For Linux based autopilots, the network connection is launched when the ArduSub code is started. For examples, please see the documentation for your respective autopilot.

## Calibration

Once the controller is connected to QGC for the first time, we must calibrate the accelerometers, compass, and joystick.

1. Go to the settings tab in QGC and select the red *Sensors* tab on the left sidebar.
2. Choose your autopilot orientation (none for the BlueROV).
3. Click on *Accelerometers* and follow the instructions.
4. Click on *Compass* and follow the instructions.
5. When completed, the *Sensors* tab will no longer be red.

## Configuring Joystick/Gamepad

*ArduSub* provides a number of parameters to map controller buttons to various functions. This setup is required as there are no defaults configured.

We recommend the button assignments shown in the image below:

<img src="/images/controller.png" class="img-responsive" />

Each button can be assigned to one primary function and one alternate "shift" function. If the "shift" functions are used, then a "shift" button must be assigned. This works like the shift key on your keyboard, altering the functionality of other buttons while pressed.

In the parameters, you will find a number of parameters named `BTN1_FUNCTION` (normal function) and `BTN1_SFUNCTION` (shift function) for each button. You can find the button numbers on the "joystick" tab in QGroundControl.

The following is a list of functions that can be assigned to buttons:

| Function                    | Assignment Value     |
|----------------------------:|:---------------------|
| None                        | 0                    |
| Shift                       | 1                    |

| VEL_Z_P           | 8.0                  |

### Setup Voltage and Current Measurement

On the *Power* tab choose the appropriate setup. If using the standard 3DR Power Module, choose *Analog Voltage and Current*, the appropriate battery capacity, and the *Power Module 90A*.

### Flight Mode Setup

Currently only the *Stabilize* and *AltHold* modes are used. On the *Flight Modes* tab, set all flight modes to *Stabilize* except for "Flight Mode 6", which should be set to *AltHold*.

### Camera Tilt Setup (if used)

Select the *Camera* tab. The "Gimbal Tilt" settings are used for the camera tilt. Choose whichever channel the servo is plugged into for "Output channel" and *RC8* for "Input channel". Select *Servo* for the "Type" under "Gimbal Settings" on the right.

We also recommend checking the *Stabilize* box, which will enable auto-stabilization of the camera based on the vehicle pitch angle.

### Lights Setup

The lights feature is currently setup to support lights that use a standard servo PWM signal for control. Until light support is officially added to QGC, the "Gimbal Roll" settings are used to connect the light input to a servo output.

Select an available channel for the "Output channel" and *RC9* for the "Input channel".

## Configuring Motor Directions

Due to clockwise and counterclockwise propellers, as well as wiring, the motor directions will have to be tested and corrected during initial setup. *ArduSub* includes a set of parameters for this purpose. The parameters are called `MOT_MOT1_REVERSE` for motors 1-8 and valid values are `1` (normal) or `-1` (reverse).

We generally follow this process to check motor rotation directions:

1. Arm vehicle after completing all of the setup steps above
2. Move the "forward" joystick forward and verify that the thrusters that produce some forward thrust are operating in the correct direction
3. Move the "vertical" joystick upwards and verify that the thrusters that produce some vertical thrust are operating int the correct direction

Provided that the correct frame configuration was chosen during compilation, you should not need to perform any more validation than that.
