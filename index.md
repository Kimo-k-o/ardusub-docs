## What is ArduSub?

The *ArduSub* project is a fully-featured, open-source controller for remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Based on the popular *ArduCopter* code, the *ArduSub* code has extensive capabilities out of the box including feedback stability control, depth and heading hold, and autonomous position control if provided with position feedback.

*ArduSub* is designed to be safe, feature-rich, open-ended, and easy to use even for novice users.
