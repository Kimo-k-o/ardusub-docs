**Firmware for Remote-Operated and Autonomous Capabilities in Underwater Vehicles**

The *ArduSub* project is a fully-featured, open-source controller for remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Based on the popular *ArduCopter* code, the *ArduSub* code has extensive capabilities out of the box including feedback stability control, depth and heading hold, and autonomous position control if provided with position feedback.

*ArduSub* is designed to be safe, feature-rich, open-ended, and easy to use even for novice users.

## System Components

- A PixHawk or other DroneCode-compatible autopilot loaded with the latest version of the [ArduSub firmware](#).
- [QGroundControl software] for setup, configuration, and operation of the vehicle.
- A [suitable ROV or AUV](http://bluerobotics.com) for use with the software
- Many other useful additions: depth sensors, tether communications, cameras, and other sensors and actuators

## ROV/AUV Types

### ROVs

- *ArduSub* currently supports two frame configurations:
	- **Vectored Frame** giving excellent smooth control and stability 
	- **BlueROV 6DOF Frame** for maneuvering in unique 6 degree-of-freedom control

### AUVs

- *ArduSub* has not yet been tested with any AUVs but they will be added in the future
